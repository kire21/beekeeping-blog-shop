# What Are Honeybees

**Honeybee**, (tribe Apini), also spelled honey bee, any of a group of insects in the family Apidae (order Hymenoptera) that in a broad sense includes all bees that make honey. In a stricter sense, honeybee applies to any one of seven members of the genus Apisâ€”and usually only the single species, Apis mellifera, the domestic [honeybee](https://www.britannica.com/animal/domestic-honeybee). This species is also called the European honeybee or the western honeybee.

## Apis species

With the exception of A. mellifera, all other Apis species are confined to parts of southern or southeastern Asia. A. florea, the dwarf honeybee, occurs in southern Asia, where it builds its nests in trees and shrubs. A. andreniformis, the black dwarf honeybee, is native to forested habitats of southeastern Asia. A. dorsata, the giant honeybee, also occurs in southeastern Asia and sometimes builds combs nearly three metres (more than nine feet) in diameter.

Did you know that:

- Bees have 5 eyes
- Bees are insects, so they have 6 legs
- Male bees in the hive are called drones
- Bees fly about 20 mph
- Female bees in the hive (except the queen) are  called worker bees
- Number of eggs laid by queen: 2,000 per day is the high
- Losing its stinger will cause a bee to die
- Bees have been here about 30 million years!
